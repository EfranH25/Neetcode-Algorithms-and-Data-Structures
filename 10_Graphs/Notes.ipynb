    "## Definition\n",
    "A **complete graph** is a **simple graph** in which **every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge**.\n",
    "- **Simple graph** means:\n",
    "  - No self-loops (no edge from a vertex to itself).\n",
    "  - No multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.\n",
    "Formally:\n",
    "- If a graph has `n` vertices, then a complete graph is denoted as **Kₙ**.\n",
    "- The number of edges is:\n",
    "E = (n*(n-1))/2\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "- **K₂** → Two vertices connected by one edge.\n",
    "- **K₃** → Three vertices, each connected to each other (triangle).\n",
    "- **K₄** → Four vertices, each connected to each other (tetrahedron-like structure).\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Properties\n",
    "- **Maximum number of edges** possible for `n` vertices.\n",
    "- **Degree of each vertex** = `n-1` (each vertex is connected to all others).\n",
    "- **Undirected & simple** by definition.\n",
    "- Often used in **networking, optimization, and algorithms** (e.g., shortest path problems, traveling salesman problem) to model *fully connected* systems.\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Contrast with Directed Graphs\n",
    "- **Complete directed graph without self-loops** → every pair of distinct vertices has **two directed edges** (one in each direction).\n",
    "- **Complete directed graph with self-loops** → every vertex has an edge to every vertex (including itself), so total edges = `n²`.\n",
